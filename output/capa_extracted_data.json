Description of Deviation\nDuring routine in-process inspection at 11:30 AM on 23-May-2025, the QA Inspector observed that cartons printed for Batch ASP-\n25-004 displayed incorrect product text and label alignment. The printed carton text read \u201cAspirin Tablets 650 mg\u201d instead of\n\u201cAspirin Tablets 325 mg.\u201d\nThe error was detected on approximately 60 cartons out of the running lot of 8,205. The printing deviation was confined to a\nsingle label roll. The operation was immediately stopped, and affected materials were quarantined under QA supervision.\n2. Immediate Action Taken\n\u2022 Cartoning operation stopped immediately.\n\u2022 All cartons on conveyor and packing table isolated and counted.\n\u2022 60 misprinted cartons segregated and labeled as \u201cRejected \u2013 Label Misprint.\u201d\n\u2022 QA informed at 11:35 AM; area placed under hold status.\n\u2022 Deviation Report QA/DEV/2025/046 initiated.\n3. Batch Status\nBatch ASP-25-004 placed on hold pending QA investigation and risk assessment. No cartons released for tertiary packing or\ndispatch at the time of detection.\n4. Impact Assessment\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\u2022 Misprinted cartons confined to single roll used between 11:15\u201311:30 AM.\n\u2022 No cartons from affected roll entered finished goods area.\n\u2022 Product identity, traceability, and potency not compromised.\n\u2022 No impact on product quality; however, labeling error classified as Critical due to traceability risk.\n5. Probable Root Cause (Preliminary)\nOperator selected incorrect label template from label printer software drop-down list. The batch and strength were manually\nentered without independent verification.\n6. Immediate Containment\n\u2022 60 cartons rejected and quarantined under QA supervision.\n\u2022 Label printing operation temporarily suspended.\n\u2022 Label roll and printer examined for data error.\n\u2022 QA sealed printer access until investigation completed.\n7.

Summary of Deviation\nOn 23-May-2025, during the cartoning of Batch ASP-25-004, QA detected misprinted cartons bearing the incorrect product\nstrength (\u201cAspirin Tablets 650 mg\u201d instead of \u201c325 mg\u201d). The deviation occurred between 11:15 AM and 11:30 AM and affected 60\ncartons. Operations were immediately halted, and the affected lot was segregated and quarantined.\nThe error was classified as Critical due to the potential for product misidentification.\n2. Investigation Methodology\nThe investigation followed the structured GMP approach:\n\u2022 Review of process records: BMR, equipment logbooks, and reconciliation sheets.\n\u2022 Interview with involved personnel.\n\u2022 Verification of label artwork, template version, and printer logs.\n\u2022 Cross-check of SOP adherence.\n\u2022 Application of 5-Whys and Fishbone Analysis.\n3.

Operator manually selected incorrect\n2\ntemplate in printer software.\n3 Why was the selection not verified? Second-person verification\n3 (supervisor sign-off) was skipped\nbefore starting print.\n4 Why was the verification skipped? Operator assumed same template\n4 from previous batch was valid;\nsupervisor was attending another line.\n5 Why was such assumption possible? SOP for label verification lacked a\nmandatory system lockout or\n5\nchecklist validation step; reliance\nsolely on manual verification.\nRoot Cause Identified:\nAbsence of system-level control in label printing software allowing manual selection of templates without QA lockout,\ncombined with operator error and missed verification.\n6. Fishbone Analysis\nCategory Contributing Factors\nMan (Personnel) Operator selected wrong template; verification not done\n1\nby supervisor before run.\nMachine Label printer software does not have version lockout or\n2\nbatch-based template validation.\nMethod SOP/PKG/LBL/005 lacks electronic interlock for template\n3\nconfirmation.\nMaterial Correct artwork and label rolls available but wrong digital\n4\ntemplate used.\n5 Measurement Verification step not logged prior to run start.\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nEnvironment Multiple batches (325 mg and 650 mg) processed in same\n6\nshift, increasing risk of human mix-up.\n7.

Root Cause Summary\nDirect Cause: Wrong label template selected manually.\nContributory Causes:\n\u2022 Missed second-person verification.\n\u2022 No system-based control in label printing software.\n\u2022 Multiple similar SKUs packed on same day.\n9. Conclusion\nThis deviation originated due to human error supported by a procedural gap in the label printing and verification system.\nImmediate containment actions were effective in preventing further misprinted cartons from entering the supply chain. However,\nsystem and procedural corrections are required to prevent recurrence.\n10. Recommendations\n1. Implement electronic lockout or template validation in label printer software.\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n2. Revise SOP/PKG/LBL/005 to mandate dual verification with signature before printing.\n3. Conduct retraining of packaging and QA personnel on label verification requirements.\n4.

The deviation was correctly identified as Critical since mislabeling has a\ndirect potential to compromise product identification, traceability, and\nregulatory compliance.\n2. The event was confined to the packaging stage only. All affected units were\ncontained within the production floor under QA supervision; no affected\nmaterial was released to the warehouse or market.\n3. The investigation was thorough, covering review of:\nBatch Manufacturing Record (Sections 18.0 & 19.0)\n\u2022\nEquipment Logbook (CAR-01) entries dated 23-May-2025\n\u2022\nPackaging reconciliation data showing 60 defective cartons\n\u2022\nLabel template audit trail from the printing workstation\n\u2022\n4.
